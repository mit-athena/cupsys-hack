Description: Make /etc/cups/cupsd.conf world-readable
 This package makes /etc/cups/cupsd.conf world-readable so that it can be used
 for other packages.
 .
 Because there is the potential for sensitive information to be stored in
 /etc/cups/cupsd.conf, it is set to not be world-readable on some Debian
 systems (primarily Etch), making it impossible to build the
 debathena-cupsys-config package as an unprivileged user.
 .
 This package checks the MD5 sum of /etc/cups/cupsd.conf, and if it has not
 been changed from the default, it is set to be world-readable.
